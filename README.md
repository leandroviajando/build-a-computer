# [Build a Modern Computer: Nand to Tetris I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) & [II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2)

Software hierarchy of abstractions:

1. High-level language (OS): compiled by the compiler.
2. VM code: translated by the VM translator.
3. Machine language: assembled by the assembler.

Hardware hierarchy of abstractions:

1. Computer architecture: defines digital design.
2. CPU, RAM, chipset: define gate logics.
3. Elementary logic gates: implement the electrical engineering components.

An abstraction is declarative ("what"), an implementation is imperative ("how"). An abstraction takes the lower levels of abstraction as given.
